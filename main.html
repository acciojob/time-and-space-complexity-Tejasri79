	<p>
	Time complexity is the number of operations an algorithm performs to complete its task (considering that each operation takes the same amount of time). 
	The algorithm that performs the task in the smallest number of operations is considered the most efficient one in terms of the time complexity</p>
	<p>
	<b>Space complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses, expressed in terms of the size of the input.
	It refers to the amount of memory storage required to execute the algorithm and solve a problem.
	O(n) – linear complexity – takes space directly proportional to the input size.</p>
